In this project, machine learning techniques in randomized optimization are explored. In the first part of this project, three optimization problem domains (Eight Queens, Travelling Salesperson and Four Peaks) are created and applied to the randomized hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic and MIMIC algorithms. In the second part of this project, the neural network implementation in the [Supervised Learning project](https://github.com/EdidiongA/Supervised-Machine-Learning) was reimplemented using the randomized hill climbing, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms from the [mlrose_hiive](https://github.com/hiive/mlrose) Python library.
